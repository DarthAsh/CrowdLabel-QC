"""Error-Correcting Code (ECC) reliability strategy skeleton.

This module defines a placeholder strategy class for using error-correcting
code concepts to derive tagger reliability (e.g., encode tasks into
codewords, compute distances, and decode consensus). All methods are
stubs with TODO comments and `pass` bodies to be implemented later.

Constraints:
- Only imports dataclasses and typing.
