"""Spot Check Equivalence (SCE) strategy skeleton.

This module provides a strategy class used to assess tagger reliability
via a spot-check equivalence approach. It is intentionally a skeleton:
methods are placeholders with clear TODO markers and do not implement any
algorithmic logic. The concrete implementations will be added when the
metrics engine integrates these strategies.

Constraints:
- Only uses dataclasses and typing imports.
- Methods contain no computation and only `pass` with TODO comments.
